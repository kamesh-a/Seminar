	wiki : An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers


    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
    ( For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server )

Everything in javascript is an object. Everything. Arrays, functions, even numbers! Because of this, you can do some really interesting things, such as modifying the prototypes of Objects, Arrays, etc.
